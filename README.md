# Deduction-of-cancer-in-blood
This deep learning project aims to detect cancerous cells in blood smear images using the VGG16 convolutional neural network model. The model is trained on preprocessed images of different blood cell types and is capable of classifying whether an image contains cancerous cells or not.
